ORM Lite Android Gradle Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephanenicolas/ormlite-android-gradle-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephanenicolas/ormlite-android-gradle-plugin)[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.stephanenicolas.ormgap/ormgap-plugin/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.stephanenicolas.ormgap/ormgap-plugin)
--------
========

A Gradle plugin for Android to generate an ORMLite configuration file and boost DAOs creations.

### Usage 

```gradle
//build.gradle

buildscript {
  repositories {
    ...
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    ...
    classpath 'com.github.stephanenicolas.ormgap:ormgap-plugin:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'android'
apply plugin: 'ormgap'
...

```

You will then need to create your database using the ORMLite config file that will be generated during your build (note : you first need to boostrap the system, get a file generated, then reference it.)

```java
public DatabaseHelper(Context context) {
    super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION, R.raw.ormlite_config);
}
```

If you use DAOs : you will need to use the second contructor of ORMLite's DAO class : 
```java
public MyDao(ConnectionSource connectionSource, DatabaseTableConfig tableConfig)
   throws SQLException {
   super(connectionSource, tableConfig);
}
```

You're all set. 
See [ORM Lite docs](http://ormlite.com/javadoc/ormlite-core/doc-files/ormlite.html#Top) for further instructions.


### Example

An example can be found [in the GH repo](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/ormlite-android-gradle-plugin/tree/master/ormgap-example).

### How does it work ? 

We basically just automated a technique that is considered the [best practice for ORM Lite on Android](http://ormlite.com/javadoc/ormlite-core/doc-files/ormlite_4.html#Config-Optimization) : it uses a configuration file, genereated at build time, so that ORMLite doesn't scan annotations.

ORMGAP will do the following to your build : 
* create a task for each variant to generate the ORMLite configuration file (this is customizable, TODO explain the plugin extension).
* we also add a provided dependency to your build that contains our forked utility class. This should disappear in a close future, as soon as we submit a PR to ORM Lite and a new version is released... TODO : submit a PR with ORMLiteConfigUtil changes.

### Benchmarking

Our plan is to make a benchmarking app using the example android app.

For now, we can only give you a number from our experience at Groupon: the average gain, for all devices of our 50 million users is 10 ms per DAO creation. It might not seem much, but for large apps, it makes a difference. In our app, we gained 400 ms with ORMGAP.

### CI

Travis is almost ready at : https://travis-ci.org/stephanenicolas/ormlite-android-gradle-plugin
